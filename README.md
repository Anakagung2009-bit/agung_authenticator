# Agung Authenticator

A modern two-factor authentication app built with Flutter. This application provides TOTP code generation and secure user verification integrated with Firebase Authentication. It offers a dynamic user experience with light/dark themes and in-app update detection.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

Agung Authenticator is a cross-platform Flutter app designed to secure your accounts using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). The application is built with Firebase authentication and supports biometric (local) authentication along with a sleek material design that adapts dynamically to your system theme. The app ensures that sensitive operations like viewing passwords require successful user authentication.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Features

- **TOTP Generation**  
  Create time-based one-time passwords with automatic updates and expiration timers.

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Uses Firebase Authentication along with local device authentication (biometric or PIN) to confirm user identity before granting access to sensitive data.

- **Dynamic Theming**  
  Leverage DynamicColorBuilder and ThemeService to support light, dark, or system default modes for a personalized look.

- **Automatic Update Checking**  
  Integrated update checking notifies users when a new version is available and provides a direct download link via GitHub.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Clean layouts, custom widgets, and interactive elements make it easy to get started.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Requirements

Before running Agung Authenticator, make sure you have the following installed:

- Flutter SDK (compatible with Flutter 3.x or later)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio or Xcode (for Android/iOS development)
- A configured Firebase project (the repository includes a sample google-services.json configuration)
- Android API level 35 or higher
- Java 11 for Android build (specified in the gradle configuration)

Additional packages and plugins used include:
- Firebase Authentication
- local_auth for biometric authentication
- shared_preferences for persistent storage
- Provider for state management

## Configuration

Agung Authenticator requires some initial configuration before use. Ensure you update the following settings as necessary:

- **Firebase Settings**  
  Update the Firebase project information in the `android/app/google-services.json` file. For iOS, check your `AppFrameworkInfo.plist` and related files.

- **Build Settings**  
  - Android build configuration requires Java 11 and proper gradle settings (see files such as `android/settings.gradle.kts` and `gradle-wrapper.properties`).
  - For Flutter, update the environment in the `pubspec.yaml` file if necessary.
  
- **Theme and Localization**  
  The app supports dynamic themes. Adjust theme preferences using the in-app settings and ensure that Device DynamicColor is enabled for better visual appearance.

- **Authentication Providers**  
  Check the implementation in `lib/services/auth_check.dart` to ensure you have enabled the desired local authentication methods (biometric, PIN, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------
## Usage

After installation and configuration, launching Agung Authenticator will bring you to the login screen. The key usage features are:

- **Login and Authentication**  
  Users must sign in using Firebase credentials. After login, accessing password details or other sensitive data prompts a secure local authentication.

- **TOTP Generation and Display**  
  TOTP codes are generated using the TOTPService. The user interface refreshes every 30 seconds (or based on configured expiry) to ensure that codes are always up-to-date. The widget layout (see files like `android/app/src/main/res/layout/totp_widget_layout.xml`) is optimized for clear presentation.

- **Theme Switching**  
  Users can switch between light, dark, or system default themes through the app settings integrated with Provider and DynamicColorBuilder.

- **Updates**  
  Upon app launch, the UpdateService checks for newer versions. If an update is available, a dialog appears with options for downloading the update directly.

Use the on-screen buttons and drawer menus to navigate between screens like the HomeScreen, LoginScreen, and detailed password views.
